# Random Password Generator 🔐

A **command-line password generator** built in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria such as password length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols).

## 📝 Project Description

This beginner-friendly project helps you learn the following concepts:

1. **Randomization**: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.
2. **User Input Validation**: Validate user input for password length and character types.
3. **Character Set Handling**: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).

Users can specify:
- Password length.
- Whether they want to include letters, numbers, and/or symbols.

## ⚙️ Features

- Generate random passwords.
- Customize password based on the following criteria:
  - Letters (Uppercase and Lowercase)
  - Numbers
  - Symbols (Special Characters)
- Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **random** module for randomization.
- **string** module for character sets.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shadowking06/random-password-generator.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd random-password-generator
    ```

3. **Run the program**:
    ```bash
    python password_generator.py
    ```

4. **Input the required parameters** when prompted:
   - Password Length
   - Include letters? (y/n)
   - Include digits? (y/n)
   - Include symbols? (y/n)

5. The generated password will be displayed on the screen.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- **Randomization**: Used `random.choice()` to generate random passwords.
- **User Input Validation**: Ensured valid input from users.
- **Character Set Handling**: Managed letters, numbers, and symbols for password generation.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Option to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
- Add password strength validation (at least one letter, one digit, and one symbol).
- GUI version using Tkinter.
